This repository includes all the C++ codes that I have written, including:
- In class practice, lab sessions, and exams of Computer Programming by Prof. Hung-Yun Hsieh, Fall 2022
  - Most are basic syntax and functions
  - Final project is [here](https://github.com/syuanjichen/CPL), which is a small RPG game. I was in charge of **random drawing** of cards and card skill design.
- Practices of coding problems online
